## Description
I was tasked with creating a weather app which allows the user to search a city and then is presented with the currenyt and future conditions for that city. The city is supposed to be added to the search history but i couldnt find a way to do that. Each day has an icon associated with the conditions for that day. The 5 day forecast also displays the date.
